# Abelt

### A utility belt for tables

This plugin is similiar but completely rewritten from [this forked version of tablesorter](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter).

### Browser support

Abelt will work with jquery 1.9+ but we don't plan on making any effort to support older versions of Internet Explorer... it may work, but there will not be any active testing done to ensure support.

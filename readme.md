# Abelt

### A utility belt for tables

This plugin is similiar but completely rewritten from [this forked version of tablesorter](//github.com/Mottie/tablesorter).

It is still a work-in-progress!

### Browser support

We don't plan on making any effort to support older browser versions, especially Internet Explorer... it may work, but there will not be any active testing done to ensure support.

Abelt will work with jquery 1.9+.
